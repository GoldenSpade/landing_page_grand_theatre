# [Landing Page - Grand Theater.](https://goldenspade.github.io/landing_page_grand_theatre) #

The page is fully responsive for screens with a width of 350px and more.

The landing page was made according to the BEM methodology.
Any blocks can be reused.

Responsive-adaptive layout was created by using "rubber blocks", flexboxes and media queries.

Media-breakpoints:
350px, 576px, 768px, 992px, 1410px and more.

The gallery in the header is written in pure Javascript. The images are automatically changed every 5 seconds. This parameter can be easily change in the script settings (there are comments in the script).

The burger menu will be displayed on mobile devices.

All transitions and hover-effects are performed with a 400ms delay. This parameter was moved to a variables in the "_vars" file.

In total, to variables were moved: colors, transition durations and sizes of all fonts.

One "sectionTitle" mixin was created and used for titles of blocks.

The SASS preprocessor with SCSS syntax was used.

Fonts are placed in a separate file "_fonts".

The "year" in footer updates automatically from js-file.

For implementation of the project, was used Parcel-Bundler.
It's easy to set up and very fast.
